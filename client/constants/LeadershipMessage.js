		Manipal University Jaipur is envisaged to be an enduring global center of excellence in higher education, with national and international collaborations and partnerships. Winning accolades and awards of national and international stature and creating world class infrastructure, has become the hallmark and pride of Manipal University Jaipur. The niche carved and crafted by the Manipal Group is brimmed with vision, mission and values, fostering academic, research and professional excellence in all domains and disciplines.

		<br>
		This month is significant for us in very many ways and one of the reasons to applaud is the monthly E-newsletter “Bioscope”, which has completed the journey of one year, a journey which started as a part of the decennial celebration, showcasing the events celebrated on completion of ten glorious years of our existence and achievements in this part of the country and globe. The number of honors and prizes that the varsity has received since 2011, is commendable, and demonstrates its commitment to impart knowledge with wisdom and excellence. It is always heartening to see the glimpses of the journey, the progress made in academics, research and innovation, the progress that is undoubtedly the result of the best practices carried out at MUJ. The newsletter has made us re-live our past and celebrate our present. The new normal, after the pandemic, has not only changed our lives, but has also extracted the best of our abilities in imparting knowledge through technological advancements and tools, to the young aspiring minds. The new conducive environment of knowledge sharing, will keep nourishing, enriching, and transforming the young lives and creative minds.
		<br>
		<br>
		I congratulate the Team Bioscope for registering the activities monthly, reflecting and recording events and memories with utmost zeal and enthusiasm. The true spirit of the University rests in blooming and blossoming of the knowledge seekers through creativity and learning.
